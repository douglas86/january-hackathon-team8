## UX
This website is not targeting any specific demographic of users. 
The site is focused on simplicity and ease of navigation so users can interact with features as easily as possible.

## User stories

We decided upon the following points, which are applicable to the users:

- As a user, I want to see a clear logo and the name of the application so that I know I'm using the right app.
- As a user, I want to easily access notifications and help through icons on the dashboard so I can stay informed and get assistance when needed.
- As a user, I want to see my profile picture and name prominently displayed, along with a logout button for my security.
- As a user, I desire to access the settings icon to adjust my app settings or personal preferences.
- As a user, I want to see an overview of my upcoming bills, savings, spending, and income on the dashboard so I can easily track my financial health.
- As a user, I want to be able to navigate to a budget tab to view and manage my monthly budget.
- As a user, I want to view my budget history and make comparisons to previous months.
- As a user, I want a tab for reports where I can see detailed spending, income and budget overview reports.
- As a user, I would like a dedicated tab for a currency converter tool with a straightforward interface to convert between currencies.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the current exchange rates and my past conversions for reference.
- As a user, I expect to find links to legal information, privacy policy, and terms of service in the footer section.
- As a user, I want to see copyright information in the footer to understand the ownership of the app content.
